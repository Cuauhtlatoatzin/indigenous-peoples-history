# Genetics

Genetic studies are an area fraught with criticism. Some of these criticisms are for good reason, some from fear ([and there can be good reason behind the fear, too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Diversity_Project#Potential_problems)). A proper scientific understanding of genetics is necessary to draw conclusions about the following papers. Any understanding mired in the nonsense of racism is bound to produce further nonscientific nonsense. Any studies which do not respect that ownership and copyright are not concepts recognized by indigenous peoples sovereign nations. The earth and all of creation "owns" the genetics. No one can retain ownership or copyright over genetics. Those concepts applied to genes and genetics are rendered as nonsense in many indigenous worldviews, including my own.

That being said, here is a the high-level overview of the very basics:

* An average person has an estimated 37,200,000,000,000 cells containing some genetic material.
* Genetic material contains DNA and RNA.
* Only nucleated cells have DNA.
* Both RNA and DNA are passed on from parents to offspring, but the mechanism for some of the transfer is not fully understood.
* A complete DNA sequence has over 6,000,000,000 base pairs.
* Base pairs are two each of (A - adenine, C - cytosine, G - guanine, T - thymine). These have a particular way of matching up with each other so only certain combinations are possible.
* These base pairs form strands which are weakly bonded through the base pair bond. One stand is the sense strand, the other is the anti-sense strand.
* These two strands form a double helix.
* The DNA is stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes in the nucleus of a cell.
* Parts of chromosomes are broken down into genes, which code for specific molecules.
* The DNA is comprised of sequences which code for molecules (exons) and DNA which typically gets turned into RNA (introns).
* In exons, every three base pairs codes for a part of a protein. This unit is called a codon.
* Any gene coding for a protein can have mutations or several options (one might code for brown eyes, another for blue).
* The different possible genes (with mutations or changes between them) are called alleles.
* The differences between alleles are typically reduced to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). An SNP is the smallest change (mutation) one can make to a region that codes for molecules by swapping out one of the letters that code for a nucleotide. Many times, the alleles will have long sequences of SNPs.
* The exons (complete set of genetic material that codes for molecules) comprise about 1% of genetic material.
* Many genetic tests check a maximum of 10% of the exon SNPs.
* This means genetic tests only check a maximum of 0.1% of genetic material, unless they do full exon sequencing tests.
* The complete genetic sequence of any human being has not been sequenced. See the article: [Psst, the human genome was never completely sequenced. Some scientists say it should be](https://www.statnews.com/2017/06/20/human-genome-not-fully-sequenced/).
* Additionally, only populations which are sedentary and not traveling and continually mixing DNA develop distinct statistical differences. Those traveling together will likely receive similar mutations to SNPs through interacting with a similar environment.
* Additionally, there is heritable epigenetic coding. Most tests and research papers ignore this. Also, we don't fully understand how this happens since the epigenetic coding is wiped and reprogrammed through an as of yet undiscovered process.

You should take a look at [Whole genome sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_genome_sequencing) over at Wikipedia for more info.

* [Genetic Structure of Human Populations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10980474_Genetic_Structure_of_Human_Populations) - This is the original paper that started the meme that humans are roughly 99.9% the same.

The second take away was the intra-group genetic variation is greater than inter-group genetic variation.

  * `Together, these results reaffirm that within-population variation accounts for most of the genetic diversity in humans. However, the between-population variance is sufficient to reveal consistent population structure because subtle but nonrandom differences between populations accumulate over a large number of loci and yield principal components that can account for a major portion of the variation (21).`
