Mountain glaciers were near or at their maximum extent by ~30 ka, which is broadly contemporaneous with the interval when global ice sheets first reached their maxima.

Eventually, as the water got hundreds of feet deep, the ice dams gave way and released floods of nearly unimaginable proportions.

## Sea Levels

* [Aburto-Oropeza, O., et al. (2021) Relict inland mangrove ecosystem reveals Last Interglacial sea levels. PNAS, 118(41) e2024518118.](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2024518118)
  * > Two studies (12, 13) have described red mangrove ecosystems along the Mexican Caribbean coast separated from the sea by sandbars as “fossil lagoons,” implying that they are thought to have been connected to the sea in the past. Other authors (14) have described an inland red mangrove ecosystem in Barbuda some 15 km from the coast, around 6 to 9 m above the current level of the sea, associated with inland lithified beach ridges of Pleistocene origin, and have advanced the hypothesis that they might represent a vegetation relict of the period of formation of the ridges. A similar study (15) on the inland mangroves of Inagua (Bahamas) noted that inland mangroves in Caribbean islands are always found in karstic, calcium-rich environments. Woodroffe described the occurrence of a unique stand of oriental mangrove Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (Rhizophoraceae) on a freshwater spring 24 to 37 m above current sea level on a terrace that has been dated as formed during the Last Interglacial at Christmas Island, Indian Ocean and discussed the hypothesis that this stand is a coastal lagoon relict that has persisted at this freshwater site since then (6). Finally, a recent study on community structure of swamp forests throughout the larger Usumacinta River basin in Mexico (16) described the presence of an “isolated, relictual population” of Rhizophora mangle along the limestone banks of the San Pedro River, underscoring the urgent need to preserve these mangrove stands and their rich associated flora.
  * > Our findings at the San Pedro River confirm these hypotheses and bring detail to the time of establishment of this inland mangrove forest. The population genetic analysis confirms that San Pedro River mangroves are a relict of a coastal ecosystem that colonized the river’s tufa lakes, possibly during the Last Interglacial, and stayed behind along the riverbanks after the oceans receded during the Wisconsin glaciation. The genetic data indicates the presence of two quite distinct lineages of R. mangle: a Gulf of Mexico population and a Caribbean population with the two lagoons in the north of the Yucatan Peninsula, Celestún and Ría Lagartos, showing transitional traits. The San Pedro River population is clearly derived from mangroves in the Gulf of Mexico, but it is interesting to note that the two inland lagoons we sampled in the Caribbean coast (Kaan Luum and Laguna Unión) were also markedly distinct from the truly coastal populations, suggesting that these lagoons might also be Eemian relicts and that the descriptor of “fossil lagoons” used by other scientists is possibly correct. More research remains to be done to understand the formation and timing of these sinkhole lagoons.
  * > Studying fossilized coastal coral reefs in the Yucatan Peninsula, Blanchon et al. (17) found evidence for a rapid sea level rise event during the Last Interglacial, implying an episode of rapid ice loss with sea level rise rates higher than 36 mm ⋅ yr−1. At such rates, the Tabasco Lowlands could have become flooded under ocean water on the scale of centuries, not millennia. The mangrove ecosystem must have colonized the shifting coasts in only a few generations. The Last Interglacial flooding hypothesis is also in agreement with the fact that Chichankanab, another inland karst lagoon similar to Kaan Luum and Laguna Unión but separated from the Caribbean coast by a 40-m-high ridge, does not harbor red mangroves.
  * > The “bathtub” flooding model used in our study does not include dynamic processes such as tidally forced direct ocean flooding, seasonal wave inundation, and coastal erosion. These factors could have increased substantially the transgression of the ocean along the San Pedro River during the LIG (18), facilitating mangrove dispersal upriver. Although the Yucatan Platform has experienced little tectonic uplift (19), seismicity (17), or neotectonic activity (20) during the Pleistocene, the Gulf of Mexico region is located in the forebulge of the North American ice sheets and, as a result, may have experienced substantial glacial isostatic adjustments during the Eemian (21). Furthermore, the Balancán terraces are on the transition between the limestone of the Yucatan Platform and the sedimentary basin of the Tabasco Lowlands that formed during the Holocene. The possibility exists that the massive accumulation of sediments could have produced some elevational changes on the basin’s edges, where the Balancán terraces lie. Despite these potential sources of variation, the 10-m elevation of the fossil lagoon sediments we found coincides closely with the 6- to 9-m relative sea level rise reported by other studies for the Eemian highstand (21, 22).

  * > To isolate and assess the time scale over which viscoelastic uplift of marine-based sectors of West Antarctica will continue beyond the melt phase, we initially adopt an instantaneous deglaciation of these sectors. To compute GMSL change for each scenario, we track the total volume of meltwater leaving West Antarctica over the course of the simulation and divide this by the area of the open ocean, where the open ocean is defined as the area outside the initial region covered by grounded marine-based ice. The instantaneous elastic rebound of exposed, marine-based sectors of West Antarctica increases the net GMSL at the end of the melt phase by ~0.2 m for both melting scenarios (Fig. 1, A and B, solid lines). Subsequent viscoelastic uplift of these sectors adds another ~0.8 m. Thus, the net contribution to GMSL due to the outflux of meltwater from uplifting marine sectors of West Antarctica is ~1 m, bringing the total GMSL rise for the B2009 and PSU3D1 scenarios to 4.20 and 4.78 m, respectively.
  * > The consistency between the predicted contribution to GMSL from the outflux mechanism using the B2009 and PSU3D1 melting scenarios indicates that any situation involving a full collapse of marine-based sectors of WAIS will raise GMSL by ~1 m above previous estimates over a time scale of ~1000 years. This is significantly greater than previous estimates of the contribution (e.g., Fig. 1A, shaded region). We conclude that the peak GMSL rise of 3.3 m that is commonly cited in the LIG literature for this collapse (19–23) is a substantial underestimate of up to 30%.

  * > Sea level changes and the resulting absence of archaeological visibility have made it challenging to discover evidence for early use of and movement along this proposed route (Mackie, Fedje, and McLaren 2018). Changes in relative sea level through time have obscured the vast majority of continental shelf coastlines along which these populations would have lived. These changes in shoreline position are sub-regionally specific (ca. 17,000–12,000 cal yr BP), ranging from 150 m below to over 200 m above present-day sea level (Figure 1: A-D), with considerable variation within relatively small distances. However, it is exactly along these paleoshorelines that archaeologists would expect to find the most evidence for late Pleistocene archaeological sites created by maritime-adapted people. In order to explore the potential of early habitation and movement along the Pacific coast during the late Pleistocene, we have employed site discovery models to locate potential archaeological sites dating to this early period. While this research is still in its infancy, some enticing discoveries have been made.

  * > Recent analyses of ice cores in Greenland, corals in Barbados, ocean sediments off the coast of Venezuela, and lake beds in Japan and Europe, have shown that radiocarbon date for the terminal Pleistocene are about 2,000 years too young. Furthermore, because significant carbon perterbations that are manifest as plateaus or abrupt age jumps, radiocarbon dates of ca. 12,500 to 10,000 B.P. [14C] must be critically evaluated.
  * > The most important and dramatic events discernable in the ice record are the rapid warming at the start of the Bølling-Ållerød interstadial, and the sudden onset and equally sudden termination of the Younger Dryas, the 1150- to 1300-year-long interval of cold, nearly glacial climate that interrupted the Bølling-Ållerød warming. The Bølling-Ållerød onset is dated to 14,680 +/- 400 B.P. [ice] in the GISP2 core (Alley et al. 1993), and ca. 14,400 B.P. [ice] in the GRIP core. This event, makerked within lake bed samples by changes in both pollen percentages and oxygen isotope ratios, is radiocarbon dated to ca. 12,600 B.P. [14C] in northern Europe (Ammann and Lotter 1989).
  * > Based on the GISP2 core, the Younger Dryas began at 12,940 +/- 260 B.P. [ice], and it lasted until 11,645 +/- 200 B.P. [ice] (Taylor et al. 1997; Alley et al. 1993; Edwards et al 1993; Mayewski et al. 1993; Stuiver et al. 1995). The dates preferred by the GRIP team, and by European specialists in palynology and dendrochronology, are about 12,600-12,700 B.P. [ice] for onset and 11,450-11,550 B.P. [ice] for the end of the Younger Dryas (Johnsen et al. 1992; Goslar et al. 1995; Bjorck et al. 1996). The ice cores show that temperatures dropped dramatically (e.g., 7 to 15 degrees centigrade in Greenland) over the course of only a decade at the start of the Younger Dryas (Mayewski et al. 1993:197), and then stayed low for more than a millenium.
  * > For example, a coral date of 12,837 +/- 68 B.P. [230Th] is equivalent to 10,980 +/- 110 B.P. [14C], while 13,129 +/- 84 B.P. [230Th] is equivalent to 10,970 +/- 110 B.P. [14C] (Edwards et al. 1993:963). Of particular note is a date of 14,660 +/- 160 B.P. [230Th], equivalent to 12,500 +/- 200 B.P. [14C]. These dates seem to confirm the GISP2 date for the Bølling-Ållerød onset (14,700 B.P. [ice]).

  * > In Hall’s Cave, layers below, above, and in the YD have 187Os/188Os ratios consistent with incorporation of extraterrestrial or mantle-derived material. The HSE abundances indicate that these layers contain volcanic gas aerosols and not extraterrestrial materials. The most likely explanation is that episodic, distant volcanic emissions were deposited in Hall’s Cave sediments. Coupled 187Os/188Os ratios and HSE concentration data at close stratigraphic intervals are required to effectively differentiate between bolide and volcanic origins.

  * > By contrast, the distribution of humans over time was almost entirely unrelated to the presence of most herbivores (apart from hares) (Fig. 3). Given that the model purposefully overestimated the presence of humans (Methods), their largely independent distributions from megafauna, their sparseness in the high Arctic before 4 ka (Supplementary Data 7) and the scarcity of kill sites in archaeological records, **the notion of human overkill as the cause of Arctic megafaunal extinction is highly improbable**6,8. Interestingly, the only predator–prey relationship of note in the model is the significant positive effect of caribou on the distribution of wolves (Fig. 3), probably reflecting that the wolf is well-adapted to hunt caribou.
  * > The timing of Arctic megafaunal extinction is a matter of debate, not least because last appearance dates (LADs) are repeatedly revised as younger fossils are reported5,6, and also because discovering the remains of the last surviving individuals of a species is extremely unlikely22. As a result, LADs systematically underestimate when a species disappeared, raising the possibility that populations persisted longer than is now evident4,23. The extinction timing can be better gauged with eDNA; an animal leaves behind only a single skeleton, which is much less likely to be preserved, recovered and dated, when compared with the amount of DNA it continuously spread into the environment while it was alive.<br/><br/>Our data indicate that mammoths survived into the Early Holocene in present-day continental northeast Siberia until 7.3 ± 0.2 ka (seven samples younger than 10 ka) and North America until 8.6 ± 0.3 ka. Notably, we recovered mammoth DNA from a series of samples from the Taimyr Peninsula that indicate the presence of mammoths in north central Siberia as late as 3.9 ± 0.2 ka (site LUR10) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Information 3.3). The survival of mammoths into the Holocene in these regions is probably attributable to the persistence of the steppe–tundra vegetation of dry- and cold-adapted herbaceous plants that was present during the Pleistocene (Fig. 2d). This vegetation would have provided a suitable habitat for mammoths and possibly other dryland grazers such as horses (Extended Data Fig. 5), which are known to have survived in the region until at least 5 ka (ref. 24). Together, these eDNA results indicate that mammoths survived much longer than previously thought—which, on the basis of skeletal remains, was around 10.7 ka on continental Eurasia25 and around 13.8 ka in Alaska8. Given that humans occupied northern Eurasia sporadically from at least 40 ka and continuously after 16 ka (refs. 26,27), the late-surviving Taimyr mammoths potentially encountered and co-existed with humans over at least a 20-kyr interval, therefore giving no support to the human overkill (blitzkrieg) model that postulates the mammoth extinction occurred within centuries after the first human contact6.

  * > We can therefore reject the hypothesis that the continent-wide extinction chronology is explained by species’ relative demographic susceptibility and non-selective hunting by humans. If demographic susceptibility coupled with non-selective hunting were the primary causes of these extinctions, we would expect a relationship between vulnerability and extinction date whereby the more vulnerable species went extinct earlier — but we found no such relationship (Figure 7d). However, the comparison of susceptibility under increasing intensities of egg harvesting revealed the highest demographic risk from this type of activity for the extinct Genyornis compared to the extant Dromaius and Alectura birds, supporting the notion that egg harvesting (and not hunting of adults) might have been at least partially responsible for the demise of Genyornis (Miller et al., 2016). We can also reject the hypothesis that the largest, and therefore the most physiologically buffered and mobile species, were the most resilient given the lack of relationship with the inferred extinction chronology (Figures 2 and 7d). Neither did the species with the highest sensitivities to reductions arising from the various perturbation scenarios succumb earlier (Figures 5 and 6d).
  * > This lack of relationship to the chronology, combined with the result that many of the extant species had some of the highest extinction susceptibilities, suggest that no obvious demographic properties can explain the taxon-specific timing within the Sahul extinction event of the Late Pleistocene. This opens the possibility that the chronology instead reflects either a random set of circumstances — that species succumbed to circumstantial combinations of stressors depending on the local perturbations experienced by particular populations (Saltré et al., 2019) — or even that the chronology is still insufficiently resolved. However, this conclusion does not accord well with the notion that Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions were non-random and occurred at a much higher pace than background extinction rates (Johnson, 2006; Koch and Barnosky, 2006).
  * > Another possibility is that in the case of human hunting, preferences for selecting or avoiding particular species, such as targeting larger species for more efficient returns (Broughton et al., 2011), could have overridden or interacted with intrinsic demographic susceptibility. Indeed, Lyons et al., 2016 concluded that either large-bodied mammals were selectively targeted by humans during the Late Quaternary, or that these species were relatively more vulnerable to human hunting than smaller-bodied species, or both. In addition, specific behavioural adaptations could potentially have rendered demographically high-risk species in fact less vulnerable to human hunting, such as the behavior of Vombatus to dig and defend burrows that were difficult to access by humans (Garvey et al., 2016) compared to larger burrowing or non-burrowing vombatiformes. In the case of the macropodiformes, interspecific variation in the type of locomotion — a trait not captured by our demographic models — could have contributed more to their relative susceptibility to human hunters. For example, the ability to hop at high velocities as in Osphranter rufus could have given it an escape advantage over the relatively slower sthenurine macropodiformes that likely employed more bipedal striding than hopping (Janis et al., 2020). Similar hypotheses regarding risk-persistence mismatches in multispecies simulations have been proposed for the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinction event in North America (Alroy, 2001).

  * > On the basis of the consistency in seasonal patterns among Clovis mammoths, they probably had little or no preceding experience with such a drastic change in climatic conditions within their lifetimes, making it potentially difficult for them to adapt.
  * > These seasonal patterns may have played a role in mammoth extirpation from the SPV, whether by climate change or by human hunting. Knowledge of the seasonal behaviors of extinct proboscideans should be useful to researchers modeling Clovis foraging behavior and late Pleistocene extinction processes.

### Was farming a mistake?

Certain people have notice that in industrialized societies our jaw is getting smaller (and so are certain other features of our skulls). This is an extention of the process seen historically through evolution starting with our jaws becoming less pronounced and our skulls bigger. But since the adoption of farming it has accelerated. This is thought to be due to not using our jaw muscles and not having to work to eat processed food. However the mechanism, it poses existential risks for humanity.
