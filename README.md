# Research Related to Indigenous Peoples Of The So Called Americas

This is an attempt at documenting a full chronology of the so called "Americas" since the first settlement up to 250000 years ago. Below is a timeline for the entire continent not constrained to any particular modern day country -- because modern day country borders are completely artificial and lifeless. They take no account of how people live on the geography of the Earth, they were established by colonization by extractive empire which set the course for the destruction of countless ecosystems and ways of life.

Any Wikipedia articles are placeholders until more research is done to gather primary and secondary sources.

## Overview of Current Lands of Indigenous People

The [Native Land](https://native-land.ca/) web app is currently what seems to best represent the boundaries of indigenous nations. However, as it says on it's disclaimer -- it's not actually authoritative, nor does it actually necessarily represent the boundaries at any particular time in history.

## Authority of Indigenous Histories

In many cases the histories passed down by indigenous peoples contain many truths and actual historical fact. For example, the aboriginal stories of islands being lost matches up with the end of the LGM at 10000 years ago. Shortly after then, the water contained in the glaciers was emptied out into the oceans causing the oceans to rise approximately 60 meters. The islands were submerged from then on.

## Origin of Modern Humans and other Necessary Background

Humans have a very messy story of migration and intermingling with other varieties of our family tree. We are starting to untangle the story. However, it is necessary to have a picture of what the research currently looks like for the origins of modern humans.

* Somewhere around 400,000 - 300,000 thousand years ago modern humans appeared in the northern part of Africa and in the Middle East.
* During the next 200,000 years modern humans migrated south through Africa and most likely interbred with our existing relatives already in the continent.
* 70,000 years ago, a large group left Africa and traveled through SE Asia and Indonesia and down into Australia.
* Many more migrations in different areas and directions occurred. These migrations likely encountered more of our genetic relatives and we likely interbred with them.

## Overview of new findings

[Genetic](https://github.com/Cuauhtlatoatzin/indigenous-peoples-history/blob/master/genetics.md#early-modern-human-emergence-from-africa) studies show some very interesting finds. Here's a summary from that page and this page:

* Humans and hominids came across from Eurasia multiple times, seemingly three times by land and one or more times by water. (Part of me wonders if there couldn't be multiple lines of hominid evolution outside of Africa that made it to North America before 150000 BCE and persisted along submerged coastal regions &mdash; this is of course crazy talk, but I do wonder.)
* Humans were present in the Americas since at least 30000 BCE.
* Once the ice free corridor opened up, gene flow moved from North America back to Beringia. There are still detectable North American genetic traces in Sakha (Yakut).
* Native Americans from Ecuador traveled with Polynesians back to Rapa Nui. It's entirely possible that this happened before or that people also moved and traded between the west coast of the Americas for thousands of years before colonization.

  * `We document a late Pleistocene/early Holocene stone tool tradition from Belize, located in southern Mesoamerica. This represents the first endogenous Paleoindian stone tool technocomplex recovered from well dated stratigraphic contexts for Mesoamerica. Previously designated Lowe, these artifacts share multiple features with contemporary North and South American Paleoindian tool types. Once hafted, these bifaces appear to have served multiple functions for cutting, hooking, thrusting, or throwing. The tools were developed at a time of technological regionalization reflecting the diverse demands of a period of pronounced environmental change and population movement. Combined stratigraphic, technological, and population paleogenetic data suggests that there were strong ties between lowland neotropic regions at the onset of the Holocene.`

  * `Results link morphologies and technologies of Clovis, certain western Canadian, and northern fluted points, suggesting that fluting technology arrived in the Arctic from a proximate source in the interior Ice-Free Corridor and ultimately from the earliest populations in temperate North America, complementing new genomic models explaining the peopling of the Americas.`
  * `Despite this, the geographic distribution of points in the earliest clades supports the hypothesis that Clovis, early points from the Corridor, and northern fluted points share historical affinity and **may represent either Clovis groups moving north through the Ice-Free Corridor to northern Yukon and Alaska, or the interaction of Clovis groups with humans already present in the northwestern Subarctic and Arctic**. Both of these processes of fluted-point transmission to the north are supported by latitudinal and chronological trends.`
  * `Bison were potentially integral to the adaptation of the northward-dispersing fluted-point makers. During the last glacial maximum (ca. 24 ka), bison clades of Beringia were genetically distinct from those living south of the ice sheets (32); however, by 12.3–12 ka, a southern clade of bison had dispersed northward into the Ice-Free Corridor, reaching the Northwest Territories and becoming sympatric with the northern clade (12). Our results suggest an analogous process of human dispersal or information transmission, with humans from the southern Ice-Free Corridor spreading north to Arctic Alaska. As fluting technology spread northward, bison (Bison sp.) were still common in the Corridor, from Charlie Lake Cave in central British Columbia to Engigstciack in northern Yukon (32, 39). In Arctic Alaska, however, bison became locally extinct by 13.5 ka (12, 40), so that fluted-point–using groups in the Far North had to adjust their predatory focus to caribou (Rangifer tarandus), which were better suited to the region’s tussock-tundra communities (41). Not surprisingly, faunal assemblages from the only buried and dated fluted-point sites in northwestern Alaska contain caribou, not bison (9). This shift toward caribou could have occurred in the Corridor, as fluted-point makers were pulled northward and eastward along the margin of the retreating Laurentide ice, resulting in high frequencies of ancestral traits shared by Clovis, the early Ice-Free Corridor, and Great Lakes point forms.`

  * `The antiquity of human entry into the New World has been one of the longest- running and most contentious debates in North American archaeology, with little resolution in sight. Scientists in the early 20th century, led by the famed physical anthropologist Ales Hrdlicka, were convinced people entered the New World in very recent times, perhaps a few thousand years BC. It was not until the discovery of extinct megafauna and associated artifacts at Folsom and Clovis, New Mexico and the chronometric analysis of Vance Haynes (1964) that the entry date was pushed back to about 12000 BP. However, South America researchers have for some time now, accepted dates in the 20,000–30,000 year range and have theoretically divorced themselves from their North American colleagues (Gruhn 2005), the majority of whom, until recently, defamed any radiocarbon date that exceeded 12,000 years in age. Now that this Maginot Line has been crossed, it makes sense that much earlier dates should be entertained. Since seagoing vessels were necessary to colo- nize Australia (minimally 45000 BP and possibly 65000 BP) and Japan (minimally 30000 BP), and northern latitude cold-weather-adapted technologies were sufficiently well developed to enable occupation of major parts of eastern Siberia by 45000 BP, it would indeed be surprising if colonization of North America’s west coast had not begun by at least 30000 BP, especially since Northeast Asia and North America were joined for lengthy periods after 50,000 years ago. The possibility—in fact, the probability—of an early coastal entry into the New World appears strong.`

Using the weighted mean value of 0.084%, the Amerind mtDNA lineages are estimated to have begun radiating between 21,000 - 42,000 YBP. If most of this radiation occurred after entry into the Americas, this time range would suggest that the Americas were colonized before the dates associated with the oldest Paleoindian skeletal remains (14,00 YBP) and Clovis lithic artifacts (11,500 YBP), and would be consistent with the estimated ages of the oldest American archeological sites.`

The most likely explanation is that episodic, distant volcanic emissions were deposited in Hall’s Cave sediments. Coupled 187Os/188Os ratios and HSE concentration data at close stratigraphic intervals are required to effectively differentiate between bolide and volcanic origins.`

## Diring Yuriakh, Yakutsk, Russia (260 KA, ~ 258000 BCE)

This is really close to the land bridge, if these Denisovans made trips across the ocean at that time or one of the times when the land bridge emerged since 500000 BCE, that could explain the earliest and highly contested sites: Hueyatlaco, Calico, and Cerutti.

## Pre Clovis (before 11000 BCE)

These links support discoveries on the continent prior to any currently established theories (as of 2018).

## Hueyatlaco, Puebla, Mexico (250 KA BP, ~248000 BCE)

What's interesting is that this coincides with another glacial maximum, the last in the middle pleistoncene, according to Miller KG et al. (2005) and Kominz (2001). This means there was likely a land brige the Denisovans could have crossed over to enter North America from Diring Yuriakh.

## The Highly Disputed Calico Early Man Site, San Bernardino County, California, USA (135 KA BP)

There was a rock ring discovered beneath a 100000 year old soil profile -- but there is controversy over potential contamination. There are potentially some tools from then, too. However, most of the tools discovered here come from later times 30 KA BP and 14.4 KA BP.

It is also interesting to note that this coincides with another glacial maximum, the first in the late pleistoncene, according to Miller et al. (2011, Miller et al. (2005), and Kominz (2001). This means there was likely a land brige humans could have crossed over to enter North America, see Douka et al. (2019) for more on the possible lineages of Denisovans whom could have mode this journey along with Stewart, Clark-Wilson, Breeze, Janulis, et al. (2020) for the tantalizing possibility that Homo Sapiens could have been out of Africa already.

`Here we integrate data from the deepest sediment core drilled by the Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP) Leg 96 on the Mississippi fan (Fig. 1) to reveal major modifications to the Mississippi–Missouri drainage by the southern LIS over the past ~70 ka. Growth of the LIS began over the eastern Canadian Arctic ~116 ka (MIS 5d), and experienced punctuated episodes of expansion (~65 ka: MIS 4) and retreat (~50–40 ka: MIS 3) until reaching its maximum extent during the LGM approximately 26–25 ka (MIS 2).

## Meanwhile, across the pond, Göbekli Tepe, Anatolia (9990 ± 30 BC)

This is the first known example of lithic architecture built on a raised platform. Because of how this was found around some of the earliest known agriculture, it sets a little bit of the pattern for what happens as people develop agriculture and temple like structures. As it happens there's a lot of psuedoarcheological claims around this, but the evidence points to it being a community center with many more temporary habitations around it:

In part, the name is a misnomer as Plano culture extends from the Southern Plateau of British Columbia to the Atlantic coast and from Keewatin District in the Northwest Territories to the Gulf of Mexico. More so than the Early Archaic complexes of the east, Plano culture's occupation of a number of markedly different environments mimics that of its Palaeo-Indian ancestors. The core area of the culture, however, was the Plains and whether Plano culture is found on the Gaspé coast of Québec or the Barrengrounds of the Northwest Territories, its origin was originally the Plains.`
  * Basically, they went through the whole region where the bison roamed.
* [`The Early Plano culture was primarily based in the Plains of Canada, with offshoots as far east as the Gaspe Peninnsula and as far northwest as the Peace River Valley of Alberta and British Columbia. Plano was also widespread in the United States, extending south to the Gulf of Mexico.

SMP5 shares a genetic component with later ancient DNA samples from the Lake Titicaca region, a component that is also found in modern Andean populations. When compared against modern populations, SMP5 shows closest genetic affinity for the Quechua people and the Aymara people. Unlike later ancient individuals sequenced from the Lake Titicaca region, SMP5, along with USR1 from the Upward Sun River site, Anzick-1, Kennewick man, and the individual tested from the Saqqaq culture, shows a genetic affinity for modern Siberian populations, especially the Yakuts.[13]`

## Caral, Supe Valley, Barranca Province, Peru (2600 BCE)

This is one of the first modern cities in the Americas including irrigation agriculture. It is contemporaneous with cities across the pond. Recently, it has been discovered that Bandurria, Peru is older.

* [Belsie L (2002) Civilization lost? The Christian Science Monitor. January 3.](https://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0103/p11s1-woam.html)
  * `A civilization arises because it controls something important. Mesopotamia prospered once it irrigated the desert and produced an abundance of food. Caral diverted water from the Supe River to irrigate fields, growing staples such as squash and beans. But its secret weapon may have been cotton. By growing cotton, used to make fishing nets, the people of Caral could trade for fish with the communities on the Pacific coast 12 miles away. Archaeologists have unearthed thousands of fish bones.`
  * `"There's a problem of self-identification in the country," Shady answers when locals ask her why Peru is so backward today. When Caral flourished, "the society was organized with a population that worked to do things collectively for the collective good. But with the rupture from the arrival of the Spaniards [3,500 years later], there was no more interest in the country except as a source of minerals to be exported to Spain."`
  * `Even after the colonizers were thrown out, she says, "our leaders, generally because of problems of identity and self-esteem, believed that everything from abroad was good. Never again did they try to understand the country from its geography, from its history, from its social problems."`
* [Soli RS, Haas J, Creamer W (2001) Dating Caral, a Preceramic Site in the Supe Valley on the Central Coast of Peru. Science. 292(5517): 723-726.](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/292/5517/723)
* [Smithsonian Staff (2002) First City in the New World? Smithsonian Magazine. August 2002.](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/first-city-in-the-new-world-66643778/)
  * `It was evidence of another crop in the excavations that gave Shady the best clue to the mystery of Caral’s success. In nearly every excavated building, her team discovered great quantities of cotton seeds, fibers and textiles. Her theory fell into place when a large fishing net, unearthed at an unrelated dig on Peru’s coast, turned out to be as old as Caral. “The farmers of Caral grew the cotton that the fishermen needed to make the nets,” Shady speculates. “And the fishermen gave them shellfish and dried fish in exchange for these nets.” In essence, the people of Caral enabled fishermen to work with larger and more effective nets, which made the resources of the sea more readily available. The Caral people probably used dried squash as flotation devices for nets and also as containers, thus obviating any need for ceramics.`
  * `Eventually Caral would spawn 17 other pyramid complexes scattered across the 35-square-mile area of the SupeValley. Then, around 1600 B.C., for reasons that may never be answered, the Caral civilization toppled, though it didn’t disappear overnight. “They had time to protect some of their architectural structures, burying them discreetly,” says Shady. Other nearby areas, such as Chupacigarro, Lurihuasi and Miraya, became centers of power. But based on Caral’s size and scope, Shady believes that it is indeed the mother city of the Incan civilization.`

There is even a piece of obsidian from Wyoming's Rockies. Practically all stone supply areas could have been reached by express dugout using the Mississippi's net of rivers and creeks.`
  * `Ingrained in native mythology across the Eastern United States—the land of mound builders—was the time-honored belief that geometric arrangements, circles, arcs, triangles, squares, and other layouts, kept evil spirits at bay and dispelled disharmony built up within. Mesoamerican archaeologist John Clark has found that sacred counts were built into Poverty Point's layout, dimensions, and spacing. Those same numbers, 13, 20, 52, 260, and 365, show up in contemporary monuments in Mexico and Peru and are the basis of the native New World calendar. As cosmic symbols, mounds and embankments provided magical safety and good medicine. So, while good for the whole community, they were just as good for each and every individual—personal desires and public responsibilities indivisible. This is not to say that Poverty Point could have been built without strong leaders, but public construction projects which "kill two birds with one stone" were more likely to win endorsement and gain widespread labor support, freely given. It took smart, strong leaders to recognize the meld and to resist the temptation to assert the power of leadership.`

## Buena Vista, Peru (2200 BCE - 1500 BCE) - first xicalcoliuhqui (twisted gourd)?

There is a xicalcoliuhqui made by a solar calendar in a room. The design is unified once every year by the tinkuy ("the effects caused as a result of meeting up") of light streaming in through disparate openings in the walls. It is one of the earliest instances of a [xicalcoliuhqui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xicalcoliuhqui) ("twisted gourd") motif. These motifs have been found from Southern Bolivia, all the way through to Utah and Colorado.

The round face is interesting, especially since it seems quite similar to the round jaguar faces found in the Lenca dynasty of El Salvador and in the "Olmec" Loma Zapote site in El Azuzul, San Lorenzo, Veracruz.

## Cueva del Chileno - Near Alota Canton, Sora River valley, Lípez highlands, Bolivia (2136 BCE – 1778 BCE, 905 CE – 1170 CE)

There was a bundle from 905 CE – 1170 CE found in this cave. It contined a bag made of three fox snouts (Lycalopex culpaeus) which had residue of many psychoactive substances. Of note is the colorful woven headband of green, red, and yellow with the very obvious xicalcoliuhqui designs. These colors are important for at least the Lenca and Tutunaku Tachiwiin, and likely many others in the trading region between them.

The fox pouch is interesting, but it could just be a coincidence that the place where the first xicalcoliuhqui has two foxes on other side of a round face.

  * `In the first half of the first millennium A.D., Teotihuacan in central Mexico was the largest city in the western hemisphere. At its peak, it had about 125,000 residents and was estimated to be the sixth largest city in the world. Among its features were a number of elaborate “apartment complexes” dotting the site, with clusters of three to ten households each sharing a central courtyard. “These were large, walled compounds and each one had several apartments,” said Michael Smith, an Arizona State University archaeologist and Director of the Teotihuacan Research Laboratory. “If I had excavated this apartment compound at one of the Aztec sites I’ve excavated, I’d say this is a noble’s house for sure—it’s so big and luxurious and fancy,” he said.`
  * `But it wasn’t for nobility. “That was the standard form at Teotihuacan,” said Smith. While future excavations may show a less affluent class lived more humbly nearby, currently the evidence suggests a society where the gulf between the richest and poorest was relatively narrow compared to other cultures at the time. Among those other contemporaneous cultures was the Roman Empire, which was flourishing on the other side of the Atlantic. The gulf between rich and poor was markedly larger there, perhaps most famously at Pompeii, where the evidence of how people lived was preserved following the catastrophic volcanic explosion.`

## Cholula - Cholula de Rivadavia, Pueblo, MX (300 BCE - 1519 CE)

This is the largest pyramid by volume in the world.

* [Cholula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholula_(Mesoamerican_site)) &mdash; `The earliest pyramid exhibits the talud-tablero motif style and is painted with insects resembling a Teotihuacan style. When the pyramid was originally built in 300 BCE, there were insects painted in black, red, and yellow on it.[7] The second pyramid, which was built over the first one, no longer resembles Teotihuacan architectural style. Instead it is a pyramid with stairs covering all four sides, so the top could be approached from every direction. It measures 590 ft (180 m) on a side.[6] The exposed slopes of the pyramid are earth- and adobe-filled and represent the last construction phase between CE 750 and 950.[2] During the Early Postclassic period, the pyramid was expanded to its final form. It covered 16 hectares (400 meters on the side) and reached a height of 66 meters. The orientation of the Great Pyramid, and the whole site’s urban grid, is about 26 degrees north of west, a deviation from Teotihuacan’s orientation. This orientation is aligned with the summer solstice, and it may relate to the worship of a solar deity related to the Mixtec 7 Flower, or Aztec Tonacatecuhtli.[1]`
* Tlachihualtepetl ("they made a stone hill") phase (CE 700–1200): used by Olmeca-Xicallanca as a capital.

The name means "sons of the jaguar" in all of the four remaining linguistic groups. Kogi also means jaguar. Interestingly enough, there is a proposal that some linguist don't see too far fetched of a group which would unify the Chibcan, Lencan, and Misumalpan in [proto-lenmichí](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenguas_lenmich%C3%ADes) before 8000 BCE.

## Hohokam Ballcourts - Arizona, USA (750 CE - 1200 CE)

* [Witze, Alexandra. The Mystery Of Hohokam Ballcourts. American Archeology Magazine. 15 Mar. 2018.](https://www.archaeologicalconservancy.org/the-mystery-of-hohokam-ballcourts/)
  * `From the Olmec to the Maya to the Aztec, ballgames were one of the defining activities of Mesoamerican cultures. Beginning some time before 1200 B.C., competitors kicked and whacked rubber balls up and down a playing court. These ballgames were rich in symbolism—in some cases the gods were said to have played—and a powerful force that bound communities together. But it’s possible these games weren’t limited to Mesoamerica. Archaeologists have found more than 200 oval-shaped earthen depressions with embankments in central and southern Arizona that resemble the Mesoamerican ballcourts. These features date between roughly A.D. 750 and 1200 and are associated with the Hohokam culture.`
  * `Though archaeologists continue to debate their purpose, and ethnographic accounts are silent on this matter, most researchers now surmise that the Hohokam courts were used for ballgames, much as the Mesoamerican ones were, according to Henry Wallace, a senior research archaeologist with Desert Archaeology, Inc., in Tucson, Arizona. In doing so the courts played a major role in strengthening Hohokam identity and interactions among villages. “Whenever you have games, you have people coming together,” Wallace said. “It’s a great way of linking social groups.”`

### Speaking of Ballgames

Many ball games have been played throughout the Americas. In a testament to a possible connection to the Mesoamerican ballgame, the Ojibwe call their version of lacross, baaga`adowe -- which means "bump hips". Other names: dehuntshigwa'es ("men hit a rounded object") - Onondaga, da-nah-wah'uwsdi ("little war") - Eastern Cherokee, begadwe ("little brother of war") - Mohawk, ká:lahse - Oneida, and kapucha toli ("stickball player") - Choctaw

## Cacao and Holly Based Caffeinated Drinks Traded (750 CE - 1400 CE)

  * This is an important sentiment to note, because I also share it: `Ernest House Jr., a Ute Mountain Ute member who served as director for the Colorado Commission for Indian Affairs for 11 years, said a turning point came in 2007 when state protocol gave tribes greater control and input when historical sites are discovered. This protocol is particularly important, House said, when human remains are found. “They’re our ancestors, and there was care taken to make sure they had a proper burial,” he said. “So when they are uncovered, that burial is not complete and that individual’s spirit is left between various worlds. The tribes want to make sure they are back in the ground in a timely manner.”`

### Etzanoa - Kansas, USA (1450 CE - 1700 CE)

Visited by the Spanish in 1601. These are the ancestors of the Present day Wichita Tribe.

  * `The early Great Plains had long been imagined as a vast empty space populated by nomadic tribes following buffalo herds. But if Blakeslee is right, at least some of the tribes were urban. They built large towns, raised crops, made fine pottery, processed bison on a massive scale and led a settled existence. There were trade connections all the way to the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan in Mexico.`
* [Rayado Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayado_Indians)
  * `Rayados was the Spanish name for a Native American group visited by Umana and Leyba in 1594 and Juan de Oñate in 1601. The Rayado village, called Etzanoa, the "Great Settlement," was probably in southern Kansas near the Arkansas River. The Rayados were Wichita Indians related to those visited in Quivira by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado in 1541.`
  * `Most authorities agree that the Rayados were Caddoan speaking and members of one of several sub-tribes of the Wichita people. Their grass houses, dispersed mode of settlement, a chief named Catarax, a Wichita title, the description of their granaries, and their location all agree with descriptions of the Wichita. As Wichita, the Rayados were related to the people Coronado discovered in Quivira 60 years earlier.[2] One scholar, however, dissents, calling them "Jumanos."[3] Jumano seems to have been a generic term for Plains Indians with painted or tattooed faces, as was Rayados.`
  * `In 1601, Juan de Oñate, founder and governor of New Mexico, led an expedition that followed in the footsteps of Leyba and Umana. Jusepe guided Oñate, more than 70 Spanish soldiers and priests, an unknown number of Indian soldiers and servants, and seven hundred horses and mules across the plains.[11]`
    `Oñate met Apache Indians in the Texas Panhandle and, later, a large encampment of Escanjaques. The Escanjaques showed him the way to a large settlement about 30 miles away of a people Oñate called "Rayados." Rayados means "striped" in Spanish, referring to their custom of painting or tattooing their faces. The Escanjaques, enemies of the Rayados, attempted to enlist the help of the Spanish to attack the Rayados, who they alleged were responsible for the deaths of Leyba and Umana a few years earlier.`
    `The Escanjaques guided Oñate to a nearby river, surely the Arkansas, where they saw three or four hundred Rayados on a hill. The Rayados advanced, throwing dirt into the air as a sign that they were ready for war. Oñate indicated that he did not wish to fight and made peace with this group of Rayados who proved to be friendly and generous. Unlike the Escanjaques, Oñate said the Rayados were "united, peaceful, and settled." They showed deference to their chief, named Catarax, whom Oñate detained as a guide and hostage, although "treating him well."[12]`
    `Catarax led Oñate and the Escanjaques across the Arkansas and to a settlement on the eastern bank, one or two miles from the river. The settlement was deserted, the inhabitants having fled. It contained "more than twelve hundred houses, all established along the bank of another good-sized river which flowed into the large one [the Arkansas]." The settlement of the Rayados was similar to those seen by Coronado in Quivira sixty years before. The homesteads were dispersed; the houses round, thatched with grass and surrounded by large granaries to store the corn, beans, and squash they grew in their fields. Oñate restrained his Escanjaque guides from looting the town and sent them home. Catarax, who had been chained, was rescued by the Rayados in a bold raid.[12]`

    * N. Tabacum was generated from a parent in the section Sylvestres and the section Tomentosae.
    * N. Arentsii was generated from a N. undulata and N/ wigandioides parent.
    * N. Rusticum was generated from a parent in the section Undulatae and the section Paniculatae.
    * N. Clevelandii and N. quadrivalvis are approximately 1000000 years old. Both derive from an unkown parent in section Petunioides and a parent in section Trigonophyllae.
    * Section Suaveolentes (Australian and African) came about from a parent in section Sylvestres and an unknown parent. It is greater than 10 million years old.
  * [Tezuka T, Kuboyama T, Matsuda T, Marubashi W (2010) Seven of eight species in Nicotiana section Suaveolentes have common factors leading to hybrid lethality in crosses with Nicotiana tabacum.

    * `There was some conflict between the morphological and molecular datasets; however, overall there was a level of concordance that identified a phylogenetic sequence of taxa that reflected a reduction in the chromosome number. With N. africana as the functional outgroup, analyses showed N. fragrans (New Caledonia and Tongatapu) and N. fatuhivensis (Marquesas islands, formerly N.  fragrans var. fatuhivensis) to be a basal lineage in the Australian and South Pacific clade of Suaveolentes. N. forsteri(eastern mainland Australia, Lord Howe Island and New Caledonia) is the sister taxon to all other Australian species of Suaveolentes, which form a well supported monophyletic group.`
