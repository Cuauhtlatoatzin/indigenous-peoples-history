# Research Related to Indigenous Peoples Of The So Called Americas

This is an attempt at documenting a full chronology of the so called Americas since the first settlment up to 130 ka ago. Below is a timeline for the entire continent not constrained to any particular modern day country -- because modern day country borders are completely artificial and lifeless. They take no account of how people live on the geography of the Earth, they were established by colonization by extractive empire which set the course for the destruction of countless ecosystems and ways of life.

# Overview of Current Lands of Indigenous People

The [Native Land](https://native-land.ca/) web app is currently what seems to best represent the boundaries of indigenous nations. However, as it says on it's disclaimer -- it's not actually autohoritative, nor does it actually necessarily represent the boudaries at any particular time in history.

# Authority of Indigenous Histories

In many cases the histories passed down by indigenous peoples contain many truths and actual historical fact. For example, the aboriginal stories of islands being lost matches up with the end of the LGM at 10000 years ago. Shortly after then, the water contained in the glaciers was emptied out into the oceans causing the oceans to rise approximately 60 meters. The islands were submerged from then on.

# Origin of Modern Humans and other Necessary Background

Humans have a very messy story of migration and intermingling with other varieties of our family tree. We are starting to untangle the story. However, it is necessary to have a picture of what the research currently looks like for the origins of modern humans.

* Somewhere around 400,000 - 300,000 thousand years ago modern humans appeared in the northern part of Africa and in the Middle East.
* During the next 200,000 years modern humans migrated south through Africa and most likely interbred with our existing relatives already in the continent.
* 70,000 years ago, a large group left Africa and traveled through SE Asia and Indonesia and down into Australia.
* Many more migrations in different areas and directions occurred. These migrations likely encountered more of our genetic relatives and we likely interbred with them.

  * `The antiquity of human entry into the New World has been one of the longest- running and most contentious debates in North American archaeology, with little resolution in sight. Scientists in the early 20th century, led by the famed physical anthropologist Ales Hrdlicka, were convinced people entered the New World in very recent times, perhaps a few thousand years BC. It was not until the discovery of extinct megafauna and associated artifacts at Folsom and Clovis, New Mexico and the chronometric analysis of Vance Haynes (1964) that the entry date was pushed back to about 12000 BP. However, South America researchers have for some time now, accepted dates in the 20,000–30,000 year range and have theoretically divorced themselves from their North American colleagues (Gruhn 2005), the ma- jority of whom, until recently, defamed any radiocarbon date that exceeded 12,000 years in age. Now that this Maginot Line has been crossed, it makes sense that much earlier dates should be entertained. Since seagoing vessels were necessary to colo- nize Australia (minimally 45000 BP and possibly 65000 BP) and Japan (minimally 30000 BP), and northern latitude cold-weather-adapted technologies were suffi- ciently well developed to enable occupation of major parts of eastern Siberia by 45000 BP, it would indeed be surprising if colonization of North America’s west coast had not begun by at least 30000 BP, especially since Northeast Asia and North America were joined for lengthy periods after 50,000 years ago. The possibility—in fact, the probability—of an early coastal entry into the New World appears strong.`

  * `Results link morphologies and technologies of Clovis, certain western Canadian, and northern fluted points, suggesting that fluting technology arrived in the Arctic from a proximate source in the interior Ice-Free Corridor and ultimately from the earliest populations in temperate North America, complementing new genomic models explaining the peopling of the Americas.`
  * `Despite this, the geographic distribution of points in the earliest clades supports the hypothesis that Clovis, early points from the Corridor, and northern fluted points share historical affinity and may represent either Clovis groups moving north through the Ice-Free Corridor to northern Yukon and Alaska, or the interaction of Clovis groups with humans already present in the northwestern Subarctic and Arctic. Both of these processes of fluted-point transmission to the north are supported by latitudinal and chronological trends.`
  * `Bison were potentially integral to the adaptation of the northward-dispersing fluted-point makers. During the last glacial maximum (ca. 24 ka), bison clades of Beringia were genetically distinct from those living south of the ice sheets (32); however, by 12.3–12 ka, a southern clade of bison had dispersed northward into the Ice-Free Corridor, reaching the Northwest Territories and becoming sympatric with the northern clade (12). Our results suggest an analogous process of human dispersal or information transmission, with humans from the southern Ice-Free Corridor spreading north to Arctic Alaska. As fluting technology spread northward, bison (Bison sp.) were still common in the Corridor, from Charlie Lake Cave in central British Columbia to Engigstciack in northern Yukon (32, 39). In Arctic Alaska, however, bison became locally extinct by 13.5 ka (12, 40), so that fluted-point–using groups in the Far North had to adjust their predatory focus to caribou (Rangifer tarandus), which were better suited to the region’s tussock-tundra communities (41). Not surprisingly, faunal assemblages from the only buried and dated fluted-point sites in northwestern Alaska contain caribou, not bison (9). This shift toward caribou could have occurred in the Corridor, as fluted-point makers were pulled northward and eastward along the margin of the retreating Laurentide ice, resulting in high frequencies of ancestral traits shared by Clovis, the early Ice-Free Corridor, and Great Lakes point forms.`

  * `A human range expansion into the Americas through an ice-free post-coalescence corridor has been hypothesized and tested for more than 75 years. Evidence from Paisley Caves and other archaeology sites support the interpretation that people inhabited the New World during the time of coalescent coast-to-coast ice cover of Canada. As the ages of human occupation sites become increasingly earlier (Holen and Holen, 2013), human entry through a pre-coalescence ice-free corridor remains a possibility.`
* [Native American mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates that the Amerind and the Nadene populations were founded by two independent migrations.](http://www.genetics.org/content/130/1/153.long)
  * `The similarity of the sequence divergences of the Amerind clusters A, C, and D suggest that those were the founding linages of the Paleoindians. Using the weighted mean value of 0.084%, the Amerind mtDNA lineages are estimated to have begun radiating betwen 21,000 - 42,000 YBP. If most of this radiation occured after entry into the Americas, this time range would suggest that the Americas were colonized before the dates associated with the oldest Paleoindian skeletal remains (14,00 YBP) and Clovis lithic artifacts (11,500 YBP), and would be consistent with the estimated ages of the oldest American archeological sites.`

`Here we integrate data from the deepest sediment core drilled by the Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP) Leg 96 on the Mississippi fan (Fig. 1) to reveal major modifications to the Mississippi–Missouri drainage by the southern LIS over the past ~70 ka. Growth of the LIS began over the eastern Canadian Arctic ~116 ka (MIS 5d), and experienced punctuated episodes of expansion (~65 ka: MIS 4) and retreat (~50–40 ka: MIS 3) until reaching its maximum extent during the LGM approximately 26–25 ka (MIS 2). Mountain glaciers were near or at their maximum extent by ~30 ka, which is broadly contemporaneous with the interval when global ice sheets first reached their maxima.`

  * `The name 'Plano' derives from the fact that the culture was first recognized on the Plains. In part, the name is a misnomer as Plano culture extends from the Southern Plateau of British Columbia to the Atlantic coast and from Keewatin District in the Northwest Territories to the Gulf of Mexico. More so than the Early Archaic complexes of the east, Plano culture's occupation of a number of markedly different environments mimics that of its Palaeo-Indian ancestors. The core area of the culture, however, was the Plains and whether Plano culture is found on the Gaspé coast of Québec or the Barrengrounds of the Northwest Territories, its origin was originally the Plains.`
  * Basically, they went through the whole region where the bison roamed.
* [`The Early Plano culture was primarily based in the Plains of Canada, with offshoots as far east as the Gaspe Peninnsula and as far northwest as the Peace River Valley of Alberta and British Columbia. Plano was also widespread in the United States, extending south to the Gulf of Mexico. Some tools found in the Canadian Plains were made from stone sources in the US`](https://web.archive.org/web/20110713193402/http://www.learnersportal.com/CanadaFP/Ancient/per1.html)

## Poverty Point - Mississippi Valley and surrounding Gulf coast, USA (2200 BCE - 700 BCE)

* [Poverty Point culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_Point_culture)
  * `Many of the raw materials used, such as slate, copper, galena, jasper, quartz, and soapstone, were from as far as 620 miles (1,000 km) away, attesting to the distant reach of the trading culture.`
* [Poverty Point: The First Complex Delta Culture](https://web.archive.org/web/20131207234411/http://www.deltablues.net/jon.html)
  * `Poverty Point was the ultimate destination for incoming goods. Poverty Point stone dealers tapped into a wide range of resources from the North American midcontinent: copper from the Great Lakes, galena—a native lead ore—from the Upper Mississippi River in Iowa, soapstone from the Appalachian piedmont, and tons of flint and other materials from the Ouachita Mountains, Missouri's tablerock, southern Illinois's Shawnee Hills, Kentucky's Knobs, Tennessee's Appalachian foothills, and places in-between. There is even a piece of obsidian from Wyoming's Rockies. Practically all stone supply areas could have been reached by express dugout using the Mississippi's net of rivers and creeks.`
  * `Ingrained in native mythology across the Eastern United States—the land of mound builders—was the time-honored belief that geometric arrangements, circles, arcs, triangles, squares, and other layouts, kept evil spirits at bay and dispelled disharmony built up within. Mesoamerican archaeologist John Clark has found that sacred counts were built into Poverty Point's layout, dimensions, and spacing. Those same numbers, 13, 20, 52, 260, and 365, show up in contemporary monuments in Mexico and Peru and are the basis of the native New World calendar. As cosmic symbols, mounds and embankments provided magical safety and good medicine. So, while good for the whole community, they were just as good for each and every individual—personal desires and public responsibilities indivisible. This is not to say that Poverty Point could have been built without strong leaders, but public construction projects which "kill two birds with one stone" were more likely to win endorsement and gain widespread labor support, freely given. It took smart, strong leaders to recognize the meld and to resist the temptation to assert the power of leadership.`

  * `In the first half of the first millennium A.D., Teotihuacan in central Mexico was the largest city in the western hemisphere. At its peak, it had about 125,000 residents and was estimated to be the sixth largest city in the world. Among its features were a number of elaborate “apartment complexes” dotting the site, with clusters of three to ten households each sharing a central courtyard. “These were large, walled compounds and each one had several apartments,” said Michael Smith, an Arizona State University archaeologist and Director of the Teotihuacan Research Laboratory. “If I had excavated this apartment compound at one of the Aztec sites I’ve excavated, I’d say this is a noble’s house for sure—it’s so big and luxurious and fancy,” he said.`
  * `But it wasn’t for nobility. “That was the standard form at Teotihuacan,” said Smith. While future excavations may show a less affluent class lived more humbly nearby, currently the evidence suggests a society where the gulf between the richest and poorest was relatively narrow compared to other cultures at the time. Among those other contemporaneous cultures was the Roman Empire, which was flourishing on the other side of the Atlantic. The gulf between rich and poor was markedly larger there, perhaps most famously at Pompeii, where the evidence of how people lived was preserved following the catastrophic volcanic explosion.`

* [Witze, Alexandra. The Mystery Of Hohokam Ballcourts. American Archeology Magazine. 15 Mar. 2018.](https://www.archaeologicalconservancy.org/the-mystery-of-hohokam-ballcourts/)
  * `From the Olmec to the Maya to the Aztec, ballgames were one of the defining activities of Mesoamerican cultures. Beginning some time before 1200 B.C., competitors kicked and whacked rubber balls up and down a playing court. These ballgames were rich in symbolism—in some cases the gods were said to have played—and a powerful force that bound communities together. But it’s possible these games weren’t limited to Mesoamerica. Archaeologists have found more than 200 oval-shaped earthen depressions with embankments in central and southern Arizona that resemble the Mesoamerican ballcourts. These features date between roughly A.D. 750 and 1200 and are associated with the Hohokam culture.`
  * `Though archaeologists continue to debate their purpose, and ethnographic accounts are silent on this matter, most researchers now surmise that the Hohokam courts were used for ballgames, much as the Mesoamerican ones were, according to Henry Wallace, a senior research archaeologist with Desert Archaeology, Inc., in Tucson, Arizona. In doing so the courts played a major role in strengthening Hohokam identity and interactions among villages. “Whenever you have games, you have people coming together,” Wallace said. “It’s a great way of linking social groups.”`

### Speaking of Ballgames

Many ball games have been played throughout the Americas. In a testament to a possible connection to the Mesoamerican ballgame, the Ojibwe call their version of lacross, baaga`adowe -- which means "bump hips". Other names: dehuntshigwa'es ("men hit a rounded object") - Onondaga, da-nah-wah'uwsdi ("little war") - Eastern Cherokee, begadwe ("little brother of war") - Mohawk, ká:lahse - Oneida, and kapucha toli ("stickball player") - Choctaw

## Cacao and Holly Based Caffeinated Drinks Traded (750 CE - 1400 CE)

A varient of holly (ilex vomitoria) was imported from the SE tribes by 750 CE (and probably earlier, but we have no evidence). Chocolate (theobroma cacao) was also imported around the same time, becoming more popular by 1200 CE.

Visited by the Spanish in 1601. These are the ancestors of the Present day Wichita Tribe.

* [Tanner, Beccy. Mysterious 'Lost City' of Etzanoa in south-central Kansas now open to tours. The Wichita Eagle. 28 Apr. 2018.](https://www.kansas.com/news/state/article208617349.html)

  * `The early Great Plains had long been imagined as a vast empty space populated by nomadic tribes following buffalo herds. But if Blakeslee is right, at least some of the tribes were urban. They built large towns, raised crops, made fine pottery, processed bison on a massive scale and led a settled existence. There were trade connections all the way to the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan in Mexico.`
* [Rayado Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayado_Indians)
  * `Rayados was the Spanish name for a Native American group visited by Umana and Leyba in 1594 and Juan de Oñate in 1601. The Rayado village, called Etzanoa, the "Great Settlement," was probably in southern Kansas near the Arkansas River. The Rayados were Wichita Indians related to those visited in Quivira by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado in 1541.`
  * `Most authorities agree that the Rayados were Caddoan speaking and members of one of several sub-tribes of the Wichita people. Their grass houses, dispersed mode of settlement, a chief named Catarax, a Wichita title, the description of their granaries, and their location all agree with descriptions of the Wichita. As Wichita, the Rayados were related to the people Coronado discovered in Quivira 60 years earlier.[2] One scholar, however, dissents, calling them "Jumanos."[3] Jumano seems to have been a generic term for Plains Indians with painted or tattooed faces, as was Rayados.`
  * `In 1601, Juan de Oñate, founder and governor of New Mexico, led an expedition that followed in the footsteps of Leyba and Umana. Jusepe guided Oñate, more than 70 Spanish soldiers and priests, an unknown number of Indian soldiers and servants, and seven hundred horses and mules across the plains.[11]`
    `Oñate met Apache Indians in the Texas Panhandle and, later, a large encampment of Escanjaques. The Escanjaques showed him the way to a large settlement about 30 miles away of a people Oñate called "Rayados." Rayados means "striped" in Spanish, referring to their custom of painting or tattooing their faces. The Escanjaques, enemies of the Rayados, attempted to enlist the help of the Spanish to attack the Rayados, who they alleged were responsible for the deaths of Leyba and Umana a few years earlier.`
    `The Escanjaques guided Oñate to a nearby river, surely the Arkansas, where they saw three or four hundred Rayados on a hill. The Rayados advanced, throwing dirt into the air as a sign that they were ready for war. Oñate indicated that he did not wish to fight and made peace with this group of Rayados who proved to be friendly and generous. Unlike the Escanjaques, Oñate said the Rayados were "united, peaceful, and settled." They showed deference to their chief, named Catarax, whom Oñate detained as a guide and hostage, although "treating him well."[12]`
    `Catarax led Oñate and the Escanjaques across the Arkansas and to a settlement on the eastern bank, one or two miles from the river. The settlement was deserted, the inhabitants having fled. It contained "more than twelve hundred houses, all established along the bank of another good-sized river which flowed into the large one [the Arkansas]." The settlement of the Rayados was similar to those seen by Coronado in Quivira sixty years before. The homesteads were dispersed; the houses round, thatched with grass and surrounded by large granaries to store the corn, beans, and squash they grew in their fields. Oñate restrained his Escanjaque guides from looting the town and sent them home. Catarax, who had been chained, was rescued by the Rayados in a bold raid.[12]`

# Genetics

Genetic studies are an area frought with citicism. Some of these criticisms are for good reason, some from fear ([and there can be good reason behind the fear, too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Diversity_Project#Potential_problems)). A proper sceintific understanding of genetics is necessary to draw conclusions about the following papers. Any understanding mired in the nonsence of racism is bound to produce futher nonscientific nonsence. Any studies which do not respect that ownership and copyright are not concepts recognized by indigenous peoples sovereign nations. The earth and all of creation "owns" the genetics. No one can retain ownership or copyright over genetics. Those concepts applied to genes and genetics are rendered as nonsense in many indigenous worldviews, including my own.

That being said, here is a the high-level overview of the very basics:

* Each of our 37,200,000,000,000 cells (on average) contain some genetic meterial.
* The genetic material contains DNA and RNA.
* Only nucleated cells have DNA.
* Both of these forms of genetic information are passed on from parents to offsping, but the mechanism for some of the transfer is not fully understood.
* A complete DNA sequence has over 6,000,000,000 base pairs.
* Base pairs are two each of (A - adenine, C - cytosine, G - guanine, T - thymine), one pair is part of the sense strand of the DNA and the other pair is part of the anit-sense strand.
* The DNA is stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes in the nucleous of a cell.
* Parts of chromosomes are broken down into genes, which code for molecules.
* The DNA is comprised of sequences which code for molecules (exons) and DNA which typically gets turned into RNA (introns).
* In exons, every three base pairs codes for a part of a protein. This unit is called a codon.
* Any gene coding for a kind of protein can have mutations or several options (one might code for brown eyes, another for blue).
* The different possible options for a gene are called alleles.
* The differences between alleles are typically reduced to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The smallest change one can make to regiong that codes for molecules is swapping out one of the letters that code for a nucleotide. Many times, the alleles will have long sequences of SNPs.
* The exons (complete set of genetic material that codes for molecules) comprise about 1% of genetic material.
* Many genetic tests check a maximum of 10% of the exon SNPs.
* This means genetic tests only check a maximum of 0.1% of genetic material.
* Additionally, there is heiritable epigenetic coding. Most tests and research papers ignore this. Also, we don't fully understand how this happens since the epigenetic coding is wiped and reprogrammed through an as of yet undiscovered process.
* The complete genetic sequence of any human being has not been sequenced. See the article: [Psst, the human genome was never completely sequenced. Some scientists say it should be](https://www.statnews.com/2017/06/20/human-genome-not-fully-sequenced/).
* Additionally, only populations which are sedentary and not traveling and continually mixing DNA develop distinct statistical differences. Those traveling together will likely receive similar mutations to SNPs through interacting with a similar environment.

You should take a look at [Whole genome sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_genome_sequencing) over at Wikipedia for more info.

However, the between-population variance is sufficient to reveal consistent population structure because subtle but nonrandom differences between populations accumulate over a large number of loci and yield principal components that can account for a major portion of the variation (21).`
