The tobacco plant is a very old plant which has medicinal and sacred uses from Oceania through to the Americas. It has very interesting genetic properties and many of the plants that have been on separate continents do not mix into readily viable hybrids, though there is a combination of N. fragrans and N. tabacum which does mix. Additional research has shown that N. fragrans is part of the oldest variation of section Suaveolentes, see Marks CE, Newbigin E, Ladiges PY (2011).

  * > The genus Nicotiana contains 86 recognized species [32], [33], [34], with approximately 75% occurring naturally in the Americas and 25% in Australia. It is likely that the genus evolved east of the Andes in southern South America and dispersed from there to south-western North America, Australia and Africa [35]. The only Nicotiana species indigenous to Africa is N. africana. This species is endemic to Namibia where it is known from three isolated populations confined to the Brandberg, Erongo and Spitzkoppe mountains in the north of the country.

  * N. Tabacum, N. arentsii, and N. Rustica are the youngest in the tobacco family all being less than 200000 yrs old.
  * N. Tabacum was generated from a parent in the section Sylvestres and the section Tomentosae.
  * N. Arentsii was generated from a N. undulata and N/ wigandioides parent.
  * N. Rusticum was generated from a parent in the section Undulatae and the section Paniculatae.
  * N. Clevelandii and N. quadrivalvis are approximately 1000000 years old. Both derive from an unkown parent in section Petunioides and a parent in section Trigonophyllae.
  * Section Suaveolentes (Australian and African) came about from a parent in section Sylvestres and an unknown parent. It is greater than 10 million years old.

  * > There was some conflict between the morphological and molecular datasets; however, overall there was a level of concordance that identified a phylogenetic sequence of taxa that reflected a reduction in the chromosome number. With N. africana as the functional outgroup, analyses showed N. fragrans (New Caledonia and Tongatapu) and N. fatuhivensis (Marquesas islands, formerly N. fragrans var. fatuhivensis) to be a basal lineage in the Australian and South Pacific clade of Suaveolentes. N. forsteri(eastern mainland Australia, Lord Howe Island and New Caledonia) is the sister taxon to all other Australian species of Suaveolentes, which form a well supported monophyletic group.
