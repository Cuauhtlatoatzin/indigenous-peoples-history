Old-time Squamish Nation elders mentioned that Nch’kay always covered its face with clouds, and was a predictor of weather (Figure 3).

* Lhelhxwáyeleq - 'Three Creeks Mountain' *
* Lhílhkw'eleqs ~ Lhílhkw'elqs - 'Hook-nose, Hook-nose Mountain, Hamersly Hopyard Hill', ASM 'a mountain or rock shaped like a hook nose several miles west of Agassiz, the "nose" is a bluff right on the Fraser River just downriver from the old Hamersly Hopyards site; the rock was and is now a good dip-net and set-net site used by some Stólô people; near it is an ancient archeological village site (used so long ago no one knew anyone who ever lived there); unclear whether the word is also a body-part insult', literally 'hook-nose, gaffing point'
* Lhílheqey - 'Mt. Cheam', 'name of a woman in a story who was the wife of Mt.

Cheam)' 'can't be seen from main Trans-Canada Highway, has large rocks there like bowling balls, thunder(bird) is there, this mountain threw rocks back and forth at Lhílheqey (Mt.

* Popelehó:ys - 'Yale Mountain', 'located above the new Yale graveyard; this mountain grew in the great Flood to save the people of the area, and some people were saved from starvation by finding spá:lxw vegetable (root/bulb) food there', literally '(said to mean) growing higher, rising up' 'being one flower'

River east of Mt. Cheam' 'third mountain west of Tl'ítl'xeleqw, as seen from Silver Creek Road looking south, it looks like a heart from across the Fraser River or from Highway #1 from below its first major bend east of Silver Creek, the resemblance comes from two rounded slopes that angle together and join at the bottom with a shallow gully down the middle, this heart-shaped feature is part way down a larger mountain and faces north' *

> The Lushootseed-speaking region extends along the shores of Puget Sound from modern-day Olympia to the Skagit watershed and from the Hood canal to the Cascades. The term “Northern “ refers to the language as spoken by the Skagit, Swinomish, Sauk-Suiattle, Stillaguamish, and neighboring peoples; “Southern Lushootseed,” is that spoken by the peoples of Snoqualmie, Muckleshoot, Puyallup, Nisqually, Squaxin Island, Suquamish, and their neighbors. The Snohomish Lushootseed spoken at Tulalip exhibits features of both Northern and Southern language, though it is usually categorized as “Northern.”

"Some distance from there is a huckleberry patch, tχú-wash ('tχú weed place'; at head of Tieton River), at that place every summer the Yakima Indians always were and they gathered large and small [sweet] huckleberries. (4) There is a stream flowing there named [ayáyash] ('place of mountain trout'), they wade across it (on the Yakima trail)" [Used by naχchish-lá-ma and taytna-pam.] (Jacobs 1934:233, fide Jim Yoke) [Indian Creek ?]. tχú-wash tamak name of a mountain across from plús, Soda Spring. [Tumac Mountain located at the site named tχú-wash, which Joyce Eyley, Mary Kiona, & Martha Hardy locate just opposite likálwit, Jim Yoke's summer camp -- now Lawishwish Camp Ground. The soda spring is apparently the one located T14N, R11E, Sect.18 on Summit Creek, likely the route of the 'Yakima Trail' (Mary Kiona [Hardy 1965a]). Indian Creek Meadows; berrying place nnw of Clear Lake, Yakima Co., WA, near or on the Cascade crest north of Goat Rocks. At crest on trail from Tieton River to Packwood & the Cowlitz River; traveled there on horseback; on mountain right above Packwood; trail from there came right down to fishery at Packwood; cut timber there and ruined it (Eugene Hunn field notes, fide Gilbert Smartlowit, May 30, 1987; fide Josephine Andrews, November 26, 1990). Hunn: August 1, 1993, I hiked the Cowlitz Trail from Soda Spring Campground on Summit Creek, up Summit Creek to near Cowlitz Pass, then up & over the summit of Tumac Mtn, then down the north side and west to the Twin Sisters Lakes, then back to the start. I observed no cow's parsnip en route, but suspect such may still be found at Indian Creek Mdws. From the summit of Tumac Mtn. the only large, conspicuous open meadow area was Indian Creek Meadows @ t14n, r12e, Sect. 10 near the headwaters of Indian Creek. Based on various clues I surmise that the Yakima/Tieton/Taitnapam trail went up Summit Creek [or up Carlton Ridge], past Tumac Mtn via one or the other side, then to Indian Creek Meadows, then down Indian Creek under Bootjack Rock to the outlet of Clear Lake.
* tamá-k - Literally 'baking'; cf.

In that lake is a great abondance of valuable shells, from which the Indians made their nose and ear-rings and other valuable jewelry.'"
