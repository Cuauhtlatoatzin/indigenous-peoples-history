## Ball games

Many ball games have been played throughout the Americas. In a testament to a possible connection to the Mesoamerican ballgame, the Ojibwe call their version of lacross, baaga`adowe -- which means "bump hips". Other names: dehuntshigwa'es ("men hit a rounded object") - Onondaga, da-nah-wah'uwsdi ("little war") - Eastern Cherokee, begadwe ("little brother of war") - Mohawk, ká:lahse - Oneida, and kapucha toli ("stickball player") - Choctaw

## Similar board games

There's a curious dispersal of board games with similar boards and rules spread out across the globe. There appears to be evidence of the spread in pre-Colombian times. The games are rumored to be old, so it's possible that some of the groups which are known to have migrated to the "Americas" around the Ice-age could have brought it with them (some Indigenous people have stories of doing just that). Also possible is that when the ice-corridor opened up, it dispersed from Native American groups into Asia. It's also possible that it came across the ocean at a later time (either when Polynesians came to South America or during early trade with Philipines, Malaysia, etc.) and then spread quickly. Only more research will be able to piece it together.

Some of the earliest games used boards where the intersections of lines are where the peices would be placed. Some games, like [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), have lines that run perpendicular, making a square grid. Others, like [Alquerque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alquerque), have diagonal lines as well which increase the ways each piece can move. In some of the games, all of the pieces are placed on the board at the begining. In others the peices are added turn by turn.

In the many variants, there are typically attachments to the board. Sometimes these are triangular. Other times they are diamonds. In both cases, I they are called mountains.

## Asymmetric Hunting Games

There are a few games which generally follow these rules, somtimes with variations:
  * Player A has one or two pieces, while player B has many more.
  * Players alternate turns.
  * Pieces may only move along marked lines to adjacent points.
  * One piece may be moved per turn.
  * Player A has the ability to capture/kill/eat the other pieces, while player B's pieces can't.
  * Player A wins when they capture/kill/eat all of player B's pieces
  * Player B wins when they surround player A's pieces so there are no more legal moves.

### [Rimau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimau)

Rimau means tiger in Malay. Orang-orang means man. There are 24 pieces representing men, and only 1 tiger. It's played on a two triangle mountain (gunung) board.

![A two triangle mountain board](./images/boardgames/two_triangle_mountains.png)

1. The tiger is placed on one of the two points adjacent to a mountain. Nine men are placed on and around the central point of the board.
2. Pieces may only move along lines to adjacent points.
3. The tiger player can remove any three men from the board.
4. The tiger player may choose to move the tiger to any open point on the board.
5. The man player must add the remaining 15 men to the board one turn at a time before being able to move any of the men, but only one man per turn.
6. The tiger can capture any odd number of men (1, 3, 5, 7) in a straight line so long as the tiger is adjacent to the line and there is an empty point at the end of the line. There may be no empty spots in the line. Only one jump may be taken per turn. If pieces are captured in a jump no further movement is permitted. A capture does not need to happen.
7. Once there are only 8 or 9 men left on the board, the player moving the men typically folds since they typically can't constrain the tiger. When the men successfully cause a stalemate, they have won.

#### _The Rimau-Rimau Variants_

In these variants there are two tigers placed on the board on the points adjacent to the mountains. There are two variants one with the same 24 men (variant A), and another with only 22 men (variant B).

In variant A rule 1 is changed, so that the two tigers are placed on the two points adjacent to the mountains. Rule 4 is changed to allow moving only one of the two tigers to any vacant point on the board. Rule 7 is changed so that the player behind the men typically folds once there's 10 or 11 men left.

In variant B, there are only 22 men instead of 24. Rule one is change so that eight men are placed around the central vacant point. Rule 3 is changed to only allow removing 1 man from the board.

#### _Main Machan, Iban tribe, Borneo_

This game is most similar to the Rimau-Rimau variant A. However, there are 28 _anak_ (children) instread of two orang (men) and there are two _endo_ (women) instead of _rimau_ (tiger). Additionally, children can move by jumping over the women, but this doesn't do anything to the women.

#### _Other Variations_

See the Wikipedia article. There are additional variations found in Java and Sumatra.

### [Buga-shadara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buga-shadara)

Buga-shadara is a Tuvaan game (from the Tuva region between Mongolia and Russia). Additional information is at [Winther, M. (2006) Buga-shadara: a folk game from Tuva](http://mlwi.magix.net/bg/buga.htm). The name is likely a corruption of буга шыдаар шаа-биле [buga šydaar šaa-bile], or "Galloping Bull" or, more specifically, "Bull at full gallop" &mdash; if the dictionary at http://tuvan.swarthmore.edu/ is complete enough. The articles all seem to have the wrong translation of _buga_, but that's likely because the original sources were mistranslated from the original language as is common in colonial contexts and cases where translation has occured through multiple languages.

The pieces are called bulls and dogs. There are 2 bulls and 24 dogs. It is played on a two diamond mountain board.

![A two diamond mountain board](./images/boardgames/two_diamond_mountains.png)

The rules are different enough to restate:

1. The pieces are arranged identically to Rimau-Rimau variant B, with eight dogs arranged around the central square and the bulls placed on the vertices that connect the mountains to the main board.
2. Pieces may only move along lines to adjacent points.
3. Before the dog player can move any pieces, they must add the remaining 16 dogs to the board one turn at a time, one man per turn. After the remaining peices are placed, the dogs can then be moved.
4. The bull can capture one dog as long as the bull is adjacent to the dog and there is an empty point on the other side of the dog. Only one jump may be taken per turn. If a dog is captured in a jump no further movement is permitted. A capture does not need to happen.
7. Once there are only about 10 dogs left on the board, the player moving the dogs typically folds since they typically can't constrain the bulls and the bull wins. When the dogs successfully cause a stalemate, they have won.

### [Komikan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komikan)

In this game player A has one piece black (puma, jaguar, kom ikan, adugo), and the other player has the other 14 white pieces (dogs, goats, sheep). The goal is to either block in the jaguar so they can't move, or for the jaguar to eat all the dogs. Non-jaguar pieces cannot eat/capture.

Typically, the game uses an expanded alquerque board with an attached mountain.

![](./images/boardgames/one_triangle_mountain.png)

The jaguar is placed in the center of the board and the dogs are placed on the half of the board opposite of the mountain.

This game has many names:

* Aymara: Kumisiña
* Peru: Kukuli
* Inca (perhaps they meant Quechua): Taptana, Komina, Comina, Cumi, Puma (nowadays, Taptana is used to refer to chess)
* Bororó (Bolivia; Mato Grosso, Brazil; Goias, Brazil): [Adugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adugo) (_adugo_ means "jagar" in the Bororó language)
* Mapuche (Chile, Argentina, Patagonia): Kom ikan ("to eat all")
* Spanish:
  * El león y las ovejas (The Lion and the sheep; used all over South America)
  * El Lioncito (the little lion; used in the Mapuche region)
  * Solitario (Solitary; maybe used in Peru)

Intriguingly, the most of the Spanish names transform the jaguar into a lion and the dogs into goats or sheep, though some preserve the naming as _perros_, _perritos_, or _cachorros_. The pattern of calling them dogs fits in with
