# Structural Similarities

I've found some interesting similarities between various different cultures and spiritual practices which aren't too far from each other. However, these could just be coincidences.

## Mound

### Stupa

See [Wikipedia Contributors, Stupa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa). This earliest stupa were domes of earth. This obviously evolved into more complicated patterns seen below.

## Layered Pointy Things

### "Rock Piles"

Most of the time called other things by regional cultures: cairn (Gaelic), inuksuk + inunnguat (Inuit, Inupiat, Kalaallit, Yupik, etc.), gromila (Croatian), moledro (Portugal), taalo (Somalia), ovoo (Mongolia), ahu (Hawai'i), seonangdang (Korea), apacheta (Quechua), steinmann (German), steenman (Dutch), kummel (Sweden), varde (Norway), ometto (Italy), hörgr (Old Norse), rujm (Arabic).

### Nsude Village Shrine, Abaja, Northern Igbo, Nigeria

Since these are remade and maintained every now and then, it is likely impossible to precisely know how old these structures are for how long the practice has been done. It is believed the mother of all, Ala, resides in the pinnacle. Ala whom holds all the dead in her belly and from where all life comes ("ala" means earth and land). All plants and other forms of life come from her. She mantains order and carries out justice. The royal python is considered an agent of Ala and is an embodiment of feminine beauty and gentleness. Amadioha is representative of the sky, lightning, thunder, and justice. Amadioha has different names in different regions. Amadioha is depicted as being Ala's consort.

### Ovoo (oboo, obo, овоо, ᠣᠪᠤᠭ᠎ᠠ,敖包 [áobāo])

Means magnificient bundle. Stone or wood heaps serving as altars or shrines for worshipping heaven, other gods, and sometimes for Buddhism.

<img  width="640" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/TsagaanBurgasniiDavaaOvoo.jpg" />

### Seonangdang

Very similar to the Ovoo, but predate the arrival of Mongolian invasions to Korea. Given the structural similarity to all the above, it could have just been a very old practice. For the variations of the practice <a href="https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=574113&mobile&cid=46655&categoryId=46655">see the pictures here</a>.

### Obviously, pyramids.

#### Monte d'Accoddi, Sassari, Sardegna, Italia (~2700 BCE)

This rework of a previous mastaba-like structure to add another few levels.

#### Djoser Pyramid, Saqqara, Egypt (~2680 BCE)

This kicks off the tradition of building pyramids. The Great Pyramid of Giza would be built 100 years later.

### Stupa

See [Wikipedia Contributors, Stupa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa)

According to The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs:

* Square base &mdash; earth
* dome/vase &mdash; water
* conical spire &mdash; fire
* upper lotus parasol & crescent moon &mdash; air
* sun and the dissolving point &mdash; wisdom

In the center of every stupa is a tree of life to which prayer ties are attached much like the Seonandang and Ovoo.

#### Shwedagon Pagoda

According to lengend, it was constructed around 400 BCE. According to historians, it was constructed in between 500-900 CE. It has been rebuilt and extended numerous times.
